# Seattle-Airbnb-Listings-Analysis

### Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

### Data
The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset: 
  * Listings, including full descriptions and average review score  
  * Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments  
  * Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

### Goal -- analyze the following question
Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?

For more ideas, visualizations of all Seattle datasets can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/seattle/).

### Install

This project requires [**Python 3.x**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/) and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It's highly recommended to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

The main code for this project is located in the `seattle_airbnb_listings_analysis.ipynb` notebook file. Additionally, the `Report.html` file contains a snapshot of the main code in the jupyter notebook with all code cells executed.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
