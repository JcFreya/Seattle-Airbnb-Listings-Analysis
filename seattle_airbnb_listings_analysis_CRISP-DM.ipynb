    "## Context\n",
    "Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA. This project is going to analyse the Seattle Airbnb Listings to see if any insight from data could help Airbnb optimize the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, __CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)__ will be applied to better frame the problem and get the insight from data analysis.\n",
    "\n",

    "    * Data Understanding\n",

    "    * Evaluation\n",
    "    * Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## To analyse:\n",
    "This project will analyse the Seattle Airbnbn Listings as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions, is there any key factors which largely affect the listing price\n",
    "    * Explore if there's any common characteristics among Seattle neighborhood, and it might be opportunities for Airbnb to get insight of what kind of neighbourhood are more likely to host Airbnb\n",
    "    * Probably also look at if there's any preference on neighbourhood among visitors\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Find the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle and by how much prices spike\n",
    "    * For Airbnb, it'll be a loss if the available room can't satisfy the user demand within busy season\n",
    "    * Also, the scale of price increase will be helpful for business opportunities\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Verify that if there's a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle\n",
    "    * Get an insight on how the host and vistors change in period\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- What factor relates to higher guests review most?\n",
    "    * If we could get an idea of which kind of hosts and room are more likely to get a higher rivew from guests, as Airbnb, they can recommend or advice the hosts to get better review next time"
